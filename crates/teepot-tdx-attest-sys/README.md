Raw FFI bindings to Intel TDX Attestation Library (`libtdx_attest`).

This crate provides low-level FFI bindings for Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) attestation functionality. It is a fork of the original [tdx-attest-sys](https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives) crate from Intel's SGX Data Center Attestation Primitives.

## Prerequisites

Before using this crate, you need to install:

- Intel速 SGX DCAP Driver
- Intel速 SGX SDK
- Intel速 SGX DCAP Packages
- Intel速 SGX DCAP PCCS (Provisioning Certificate Caching Service)

Please refer to the [SGX DCAP Linux installation guide](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/latest/dcap-latest/linux/docs/Intel_SGX_SW_Installation_Guide_for_Linux.pdf) for detailed installation instructions.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
teepot-tdx-attest-sys = "0.1.0"
```

This crate provides raw FFI bindings. For a more ergonomic Rust API, consider using a higher-level wrapper crate.

## Building

The crate uses `bindgen` to generate Rust bindings from the C headers during build time. Make sure you have:

- The TDX attestation library (`libtdx_attest`) installed on your system
- If using Intel SGX SDK, set the `SGX_SDK` environment variable to point to your SDK installation
